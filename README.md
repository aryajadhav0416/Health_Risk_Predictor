# Health Risk Prediction Web App with Explainability

A machine learning project that predicts an individualâ€™s health risk (low or high) based on lifestyle factors using a synthetic dataset. The project includes training multiple classification models, analyzing feature importance with SHAP explainability, and deploying an interactive Streamlit web application for real-time prediction and interpretation.

## ðŸš€ Features

- **Multi-model training and evaluation:** Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine, and XGBoost classifiers.
- **Data preprocessing:** Handles mixed numeric and categorical data with label encoding.
- **Explainable AI:** Utilizes SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to provide both global and local interpretability of model predictions.
- **Interactive Streamlit app:** Input lifestyle data and get instant health risk predictions with visual explanations of feature impacts.
- **Model and explainer serialization:** Saves trained models, encoders, and SHAP explainers for efficient reuse and deployment.
